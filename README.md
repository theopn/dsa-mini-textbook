# Data Structures & Algorithms Mini Textbook

Here's my comprehensive review (and I decided to call it a "mini textbook") for Data Structures & Algorithms course at Purdue (CS251), which I took with Prof. Andres Bejarano in fall of 2022.

If you see any errors, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request! Just make sure to use 2 spaces as a tab and follow the other style choices I used in the $\TeX$ code.
